      '<h4>Don’t Repeat Yourself</h4>
      <p>Good programmers are both lazy and very productive. They express a lot of functionality in very little code. Once you have established a pattern for something that gets repeated again in the code, it’s time to write a function, object, or module that encapsulates that pattern so that it can be easily reused.</p>
      <p>Doing so also quarantines that functionality to a single spot in the code base, so that if you later find something wrong with the code or the algorithm, you only have to fix it in one place.</p>'

       '<h4>Do One Thing, And do it well, Less Is More</h4>
      <p>In order to aid readability and reduce the temptation to do more than one thing, functions should be as short as possible: Just enough code to do the one thing they were made to do, and no more. In most cases, functions should be just a handful of lines long. If they run much longer, consider breaking out subtasks and data into separate functions and objects.</p>'

      <h4>Keep It Simple Stupid</h4>
      <p>Programmers are often tempted to come up with clever solutions to problems. That’s a good thing, of course, but sometimes programmers are too clever, and the solutions are cryptic. This tends to happen when a single line of code is used to accomplish more than a single atomic goal.</p>
